How could the trial affect my daily life?
How often will I have to come to the hospital or clinic?
Will I have to stay in the hospital during the clinical trial? If so, how often and for how long?
Will I have to travel long distances?
Will I have check-ups after the trial?
Can my habits produce me skin cancer?
