UV light causes direct DNA mutations that are correlated with CM.5,12,56 The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified UV exposure as a class I carcinogen that is associated with a higher incidence of melanoma, especially in children with a higher exposure to sunlight and/or tanning beds.11,12,57 UV exposure is a highly preventable cause of melanoma if sun-safety protocols are followed. The Surgeon General issued a notice about melanoma prevention and sun safety in 2014. This “Call to Action” is centered around five goals: increasing sun-safety behaviors, informing the public about risks and options, pushing policies for safe habits, reducing the harms of indoor tanning, and increasing monitoring and surveillance of outcomes.Several strategies adopted to reduce UV exposure in children are listed.

Strategies to reduce UV exposure in children.
Primary prevention. Primary prevention for melanoma consists of avoiding intense intermittent exposure to UV radiation, both solar and nonsolar. It should be stressed that the dose-response levels for such exposure are not defined, but that large, sporadic doses of UV radiation on skin are those epidemiologically most associated with later development of melanoma. Sunburn is a marker of that exposure, so that the amount of time spent in the sun should be calculated to avoid sunburn if at all possible.[207] Tanning beds should be avoided, as studies suggest that they increase the risk of melanoma.[208,209] In an attempt to prevent skin cancer, more than 40 states have laws prohibiting tanning bed use by teenagers or requiring signed parental consent for teenagers who request tanning bed use.Primary prevention should stress the need for caution in the sun and protection in the form of clothing, shade, and sunscreens when long periods of time are spent outdoors or at times of day when sunburn is likely. High-risk patients should understand that the application of sunscreens should not be used to prolong the time they spend in the sun because UV radiation makes its way through the sunscreen over time.[211,212] However, regular sunscreen use has been shown to reduce melanoma incidence in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.Level of evidence: 1aii

Other strategies to reduce UV exposure in children.Indoor tanning confers a sixfold increased risk of developing melanoma among women younger than 30 years, and the first exposure typically starts in adolescents. Tanning bed-related lesions may manifest in late adolescence, but they continue to have a harmful impact throughout a patient’s lifetime as UV exposure continues to accumulate.Public health efforts, including a black-box warning issued by the FDA and state-level legislation restricting their use by minors, have significantly decreased the use of indoor tanning among adolescents.
Disseminating information of proper sun-protective behaviors (using sunscreen, staying in the shade, wearing wide brim hats, and wearing protective clothing) is important to prevent early acquisition of sunburn and UV-related DNA damage. Multicomponent interventions incorporating printed materials, interactive multimedia, and distribution of sun-protective products and community-wide and school-based prevention programs have been shown to increase adherence to clothing and sunscreen recommendations.66–68 For example, the SunWise Program developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to educate elementary and middle school-aged children about sun-safety habits is estimated to have prevented >11,000 cases of skin cancer and 50 premature deaths by 2015,
