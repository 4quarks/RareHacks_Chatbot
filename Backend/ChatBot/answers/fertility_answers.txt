The risk of infertility increases after treatment with the following: In boys, treatment with radiation therapy to the testicles. In girls, treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis, including the ovaries and uterus. Radiation therapy to an area near the hypothalamus in the brain or lower back. Total-body irradiation (TBI) before a stem cell transplant.Chemotherapy with alkylating agents, such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, lomustine, and procarbazine. Surgery, such as the removal of a testicle or an ovary or lymph nodes in the abdomen. Childhood cancer survivors may have late effects that affect pregnancy.

Late effects on pregnancy include increased risk of the following:
High blood pressure.
Diabetes during pregnancy.
Anemia.
Miscarriage or stillbirth.
Low birth-weight babies.
Early labor and/or delivery.
Delivery by Cesarean section.
The fetus is not in the right position for birth (for example, the foot or buttock is in position to come out before the head).
Some studies have not shown an increased risk of late effects on pregnancy.

There are methods that may be used to help childhood cancer survivors have children. The following methods may be used so that childhood cancer survivors can have children:
Freezing the eggs or sperm before cancer treatment in patients who have reached puberty.
Testicular sperm extraction (the removal of a small amount of tissue containing sperm from the testicle).
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (an egg is fertilized with one sperm that is injected into the egg outside the body).
In vitro fertilization (IVF) (eggs and sperm are placed together in a container, giving the sperm the chance to enter an egg).
Children of childhood cancer survivors are not affected by the parentâ€™s previous treatment for cancer.

The children of childhood cancer survivors do not appear to have an increased risk of birth defects, genetic disease, or cancer.
