Survival for pediatric melanoma has improved over the past 30 years, possibly due to improved staging. Five-year overall survival for all stages is 87–95%.Similar to adults, the main predictor of outcomes in melanoma is the stage at the time of diagnosis.Among patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, the median survival time is <1 year and 5-year overall survival is <12%.Children <10 years old are more likely to present with a higher stage disease, which may in part be due to delayed diagnosis of children with melanoma.

Data are conflicting regarding the prognostic role of age, gender, tumor thickness, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node status. In some studies, younger children <10 years old have significantly poorer survival as compared to adolescents, while in other studies, adolescents have decreased survival compared to younger children. The data are mixed regarding the contribution of patient gender to overall survival and the interaction with patient’s age and overall survival. Younger children often present with thicker tumors than adults. However, the association between tumor thickness and survival may be different between adults and children. Conversely, other studies have demonstrated that increasing tumor thickness is associated with poorer survival among pediatric melanoma patients. Tumor ulceration is also more common among young children <10 years and is associated with worse outcomes. In addition, tumor thickness and ulceration are strong predictors of sentinel lymph node metastases among children.54 Similar to adults, a positive sentinel lymph node is associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic implications of other traditional risk factors among adults with melanoma, including vertical growth phase, vascular invasion, and high mitotic activity, do not appear to be correlated with an increased risk of mortality.
